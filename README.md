# Smart IoT Car Control System:
This project demonstrates how to remotely control a vehicle using a web interface, utilizing Raspberry Pi and Python. The system simulates the movement of the car (forward, backward, left, right) through a web-based interface, making it easy to control from any device with internet access.

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to show how IoT technology can be used to remotely control a vehicle. The system uses a Raspberry Pi as the central control unit, which interacts with the web interface built using Flask (Python). Users can control the car by simply clicking on buttons in the web interface, simulating car movement.

## Key Features:
Web Interface: A simple web app that lets you control the car's movement (forward, backward, left, right).
Simulation: Simulated car movement on the web interface (instead of controlling a real car, the system shows direction changes).
Backend with Flask: Python (Flask) backend to handle the logic for each control action.

## Technologies Used:
Raspberry Pi: Acts as the control unit for the system.
Python (Flask): Backend server that handles the movement commands.
Web Interface: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface.
IoT Communication: The system communicates between the web app and the backend using HTTP requests.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio

## Run the Flask app:
python app.py

3. Open a browser on the Raspberry Pi and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to control the simulated car.

## Future Work:
Add more advanced features like motor control code and sensor integration.
Enhance the web interface with additional controls and options.
Implement real-time data visualization of the carâ€™s state (e.g., battery level, speed).
